There are two types or organisms: tortoises and hares.

Tortoises don't move much, but they are sneaky dangerous. They have a
"kill" function that will remove a hare if there is one adjacent to them.

Hares move much more quickly, and they breed like crazy. However, they
don't have a "kill" function.
